AMASING is the Aperture Masking And Speckle ImagiNG instrument. This was my dissertation instrument. Designed to perform optical (400-800nm) aperture masking observations by re-imaging the primary aperture of the Magdalena Ridge Observatory 2.4m telescope and masking that aperture to generate interferograms which can then be processed to produce visibility and closure phase measurements. Masks are typically non-redundant or partially redundant, such as a long slit or annulus.
