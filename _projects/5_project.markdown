NESSI is the [New Mexico Exoplanet Spectroscopic Survey Instrument](http://kestrel.nmt.edu/~mce/nessi.html).
Originally built at New Mexico Tech for the Magdalena Ridge Observatory 2.4m telescope, NESSI is now undergoing commissioning on the Hale telescope after being converted from a Nasmyth mounted to prime focus mounted instrument.

I supervised a group of undergraduate students responsible for writing the instrument control and telescope interface software. I was also responsible for the optical alignment, detector electronics integration (Teledyne HAWAII-H2RG), vacuum and cryogenic systems characterization, and many other tasks required to bring a new instrument to first light.
