I am an Assistant Research Scientist in the Texas A&amp;M University [Astronomical Instrumentation Lab](http://instrumentation.tamu.edu). I have worked on a variety of optical and infrared instruments including spectrographs, imagers, interferometers, and calibration systems.

I have experience with optical design, vacuum and cryogenic systems, detector systems, control electronics, and software development.

I also frequently mentor undergraduate and graduate students working on projects in the lab.
